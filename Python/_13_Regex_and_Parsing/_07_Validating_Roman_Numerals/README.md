You are given a string, and you have to validate whether it's a valid Roman numeral. If it is valid, print True. Otherwise, print False. Try to create a regular expression for a valid Roman numeral.

__Input Format__

A single line of input containing a string of Roman characters.

__Output Format__

Output a single line containing True or False according to the instructions above.

__Constraints__

The number will be between ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;1) and ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;3999) (both included).

__Sample Input__
```commandline
CDXXI
```
__Sample Output__
```commandline
True
```
